Date:   Wed Feb 11 08:12:10 2015 +0200

    Monkey-patched behave to allow for backslash at the end of lines
    in feature files to break up long steps.

commit e918c9db2b25ec1ca4004592ec1938ecd4fd5ef3
Date:   Fri Feb 6 21:54:16 2015 +0200

    Added stock_supply/scenario_stock_internal_supply.feature
    
    Refactored to distinguish between Product and ProductTemplate:
    a lot of the scenarios use Product.find([('name',...
    but (perhaps I dont understand) but it should fail
    as Products don't have a name slot. This behaviour is not
    documented as far as I can see in the product module.

commit b92375bc33479148b5d1d1d916c42fb590349e16

Date:   Tue Feb 3 07:40:11 2015 +0200

    Improved trytond_purchase.py and generalized more
    purchase steps over from scenario_purchase.py

commit 484705e2f6dfe7159237bd7da8124f8ad7cf0dee
Date:   Thu Jan 29 19:54:32 2015 +0200

    Added features/trytond/purchase/scenario_purchase.feature
    It's still unfinished but the boilerplate company and accounts
    are done.
    
    Refactored scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon_with_drop_shipment
    to reuse more steps, and share them with scenario_purchase

commit 08c8c5e634ad3fc2f20988c6334a02c930c1844a
Date:   Thu Jan 22 21:03:40 2015 +0200

    Added docs/trytond_product.txt to break out reusable product features.
    
    Added features/steps/scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon_with_drop
    _shipment.txt but it's not finished. It has some good multi-user
    tests that we want to bring into features.

commit b5f8533d6565916e956b673c8d4250aa787494a0

Date:   Sun Jan 18 16:20:24 2015 +0200

    Added a file for stock modules: trytond_stock.py
    
    Changed the coding style to use proteus.{Model,Wizard,config}
    to remind us that these are RPC objects; besides, config is dangerous.

commit c00ca8ca3f59be27cff3e9452ce8630997cb6c35
Date:   Thu Jan 15 10:11:13 2015 +0200

    Fixed more of the scenari, and tagged features with
      @works32 - works in Tryton-3.2
      @wip - work in progress, and probably broken
    
    Fixed the calendar scenari
    
    Will overhaul the way feature data is stored to make it more
    persistent.

commit 1389f419ef28755d64efa1024fc5edeb158855e3
Date:   Wed Jan 14 07:46:35 2015 +0200

    Added proteus tests - they work.
    
    Added ir.attachment tests - they run but have bo effect.
    
    Made a quick hack shellscript in bin/ to superficially
    convert rst scenario tests from the source tree to
    behave scenarios.
    
    Added features to test for AccountantsCalendar -
    Events work, but annual recurring events are unfinished.

commit 26344f02e177873532b0041394afca1df078eb26
Date:   Tue Jan 13 03:53:25 2015 +0200

    Added features/steps/trytond_calendar.py
    Unfinished and no scenari yet.
    
    Added features/steps/scenario_bank.py
    Unfinished and no scenari yet.
    
    Split up features/steps/scenario_doctests.py
    to match the module name in the Tryton tree.

commit e267921a4ec6f97e4b8d96391c9f63b5c0e0d2cf
Date:   Fri Jan 9 03:20:48 2015 +0200

    Added a quick and dirty bash script to pull the steps
    and their docstrings into the docs diectory. It gives a starting point
    for the documentation, and encourages the use of docstrings,

commit 57ec84a05b4a09cc4ce2a3c9646f20aabbd223a1
Date:   Wed Jan 7 08:33:04 2015 +0200

    Updated for Tryton 3.2.
    Still have a problem in looking up country fields;
    as a workaroun, they are set to nothing (e.g. party.address->country).

commit f52f3197ad15c6e83c7bbba6a0c5b51baf5d71db
Date:   Tue Nov 5 12:42:42 2013 +0200

    Added docstrings to the steps. I'll write a step modification
    that can harvest these for the documentation so that the
    documentation can be automatically generated from the steps.

commit eeed82f054b7b12faaf9a5777641881f847eeed1
Date:   Tue Nov 5 10:48:21 2013 +0200

    Tablized some more of features/steps/scenario_invoice_supplier.py
    so that the invoice code is easier to reuse.

commit 462200823adddf4c77775ecc430c2d719c1e55d0
Date:   Mon Nov 4 23:07:35 2013 +0200

    Added features/steps/scenario_invoice_supplier.py and
    features/trytond/account_invoice/scenario_invoice_supplier.feature
    which means invoices with taxes can be handled now.

commit 49725377de4f1d9a65c60154b4c391caef20f9ee
Date:   Mon Nov 4 13:24:00 2013 +0200

    The chart of accounts specific data can now be set, so that
    features/trytond/account_stock_anglo_saxon/scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    should work now with other chart of accounts, and other
    company names.

commit 17d849f397b4f156be8c4960fff147604f9d20f0
Date:   Sun Nov 3 16:19:14 2013 +0200

    Added features/steps/oerpscenario.py
    which are the elementary tests from OpenERPScenario.
    The aim here is to make the same feature tests in OpenERPScenario
    run in trytond_scenari on Tryton. YMMV!
    
    Refactored the scenarios to use a Set of default feature data.
    This will allow us to un-hardwire the account names, and run the
    same testing scenarios on Chart of Accounts other than the
    default "Minimal Chart of Accounts" in the account module.
    
    Made features/steps/support/fields.py use tryton to get field
    data types. Anything that is not a basic data type is assumed
    to be the "name" field of a relation, and the OerpScenario
    syntax of 'by name: Name' is dropped to just 'Name'.
    
    I'm not sure if we want to support the OerpScenario syntaxes of
    'by oid:' or 'by code:' - if so, fix features/steps/dsl.py
    which is currently broken, and keep the syntax local to those steps.

commit 69b19586cb0ca439419a8fe512d5c47f3d08cbf3
Date:   Fri Nov 1 11:06:51 2013 +0200

        Finished parameterizing features/steps/scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.py
        You should be able to use this feature to build productions systems.
    
        Made a first attempt at porting DSL from OpenERPScenario.
        Not documenented or tested yet.
    
        Now switching to Tryton 3.0 for development from now on.

commit 50092ef7445e7e612efd7a1c35c045cad8b2073b
Date:   Mon Oct 28 09:45:55 2013 +0200

    Added support for Tryton 3.0
    
    Added the first version of OpenERPScenario's DSL.
    
    Added labels to steps.
    
    Refactored some steps to make them more parameterized.

commit 5133559de602c26b6b313a7e1d73fa94804a484e
Date:   Thu Oct 24 16:16:21 2013 +0300

    Support dropping into pdb on an error.

commit 3ffe9341f945b7452a69f769e190b8f78286e406
Date:   Tue Oct 22 12:46:58 2013 +0300

    Push up to github.com - see the CHANGELOG.txt for details.

commit 6b68feaca63be376f84827e4e7b48da8ec81b0fa
Date:   Tue Oct 22 12:32:37 2013 +0300

    Started parameterizing the tests in scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    This makes them really reusable to create production systems from the
    scenari.
    
    Also added support for pdb - works.
    
    Starting support for pydbgr - may work.

commit 56c24a9565f94a06721e6806dd89db40ba18224c
Date:   Tue Oct 22 01:18:14 2013 +0300

    Fleshed out:
      features/trytond/account_stock_anglo_saxon/scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    which now runs and passes. It still needs parameterizing with tables.
    
    Added:
      features/trytond/account/scenario_account_reconciliation.feature
    which now runs and passes. It still needs parameterizing with tables.
    
    Added:
      features/trytond/product_cost_fifo/scenario_product_cost_fifo_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    which FAILS as it should for now because it is a copy of
      features/trytond/account_stock_anglo_saxon/scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    changed to use FIFO, but the accounting results have not yet been updated.
    
    Added:
       rst_to_feature.el
    I'll deny all knowledge of it :-)

commit bfe602dead1f4595d8b731382b23d877ec3d9eaa
Date:   Tue Oct 8 13:09:33 2013 +0300

    Added features/trytond/account/2013-10-scenario_account_reconciliation.feature
    and fixed the creation of the Minimal A chart of accounts to be idempotent.

Date:   Mon Oct 7 21:26:23 2013 +0300

    Added the first basic steps from the doctests of creating a company
    and a fiscal year. Still need to test the results.
