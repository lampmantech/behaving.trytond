commit 6b68feaca63be376f84827e4e7b48da8ec81b0fa
Date:   Tue Oct 22 12:32:37 2013 +0300

    Started parameterizing the tests in scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    This makes them really reusable to create production systems from the
    scenari.
    
    Also added support for pdb - works.
    
    Starting support for pydbgr - may work.

    Fleshed out:
      features/trytond/account_stock_anglo_saxon/scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    which now runs and passes. It still needs parameterizing with tables.
    
    Added:
      features/trytond/account/scenario_account_reconciliation.feature
    which now runs and passes. It still needs parameterizing with tables.
    
    Added:
      features/trytond/product_cost_fifo/scenario_product_cost_fifo_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    which FAILS as it should for now because it is a copy of
      features/trytond/account_stock_anglo_saxon/scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    changed to use FIFO, but the accounting results have not yet been updated.
    
    Added:
       rst_to_feature.el
    I'll deny all knowledge of it :-)
