commit eeed82f054b7b12faaf9a5777641881f847eeed1
Date:   Tue Nov 5 10:48:21 2013 +0200

    Tablized some more of features/steps/scenario_invoice_supplier.py
    so that the invoice code is easier to reuse.

commit 462200823adddf4c77775ecc430c2d719c1e55d0
Date:   Mon Nov 4 23:07:35 2013 +0200

    Added features/steps/scenario_invoice_supplier.py and
    features/trytond/account_invoice/scenario_invoice_supplier.feature
    which means invoices with taxes can be handled now.

commit 49725377de4f1d9a65c60154b4c391caef20f9ee
Date:   Mon Nov 4 13:24:00 2013 +0200

    The chart of accounts specific data can now be set, so that
    features/trytond/account_stock_anglo_saxon/scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    should work now with other chart of accounts, and other
    company names.

commit 17d849f397b4f156be8c4960fff147604f9d20f0
Date:   Sun Nov 3 16:19:14 2013 +0200

    Added features/steps/oerpscenario.py
    which are the elementary tests from OpenERPScenario.
    The aim here is to make the same feature tests in OpenERPScenario
    run in trytond_scenari on Tryton. YMMV!
    
    Refactored the scenarios to use a Set of default feature data.
    This will allow us to un-hardwire the account names, and run the
    same testing scenarios on Chart of Accounts other than the
    default "Minimal Chart of Accounts" in the account module.
    
    Made features/steps/support/fields.py use tryton to get field
    data types. Anything that is not a basic data type is assumed
    to be the "name" field of a relation, and the OerpScenario
    syntax of 'by name: Name' is dropped to just 'Name'.
    
    I'm not sure if we want to support the OerpScenario syntaxes of
    'by oid:' or 'by code:' - if so, fix features/steps/dsl.py
    which is currently broken, and keep the syntax local to those steps.

Date:   Fri Nov 1 11:06:51 2013 +0200

        Finished parameterizing features/steps/scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.py
        You should be able to use this feature to build productions systems.
    
        Made a first attempt at porting DSL from OpenERPScenario.
        Not documenented or tested yet.
    
        Now switching to Tryton 3.0 for development from now on.

Date:   Mon Oct 28 09:45:55 2013 +0200

    Added support for Tryton 3.0
    
    Added the first version of OpenERPScenario's DSL.
    
    Added labels to steps.
    
    Refactored some steps to make them more parameterized.

commit 6b68feaca63be376f84827e4e7b48da8ec81b0fa
Date:   Tue Oct 22 12:32:37 2013 +0300

    Started parameterizing the tests in scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    This makes them really reusable to create production systems from the
    scenari.
    
    Also added support for pdb - works.
    
    Starting support for pydbgr - may work.

commit 56c24a9565f94a06721e6806dd89db40ba18224c
Date:   Tue Oct 22 01:18:14 2013 +0300

    Fleshed out:
      features/trytond/account_stock_anglo_saxon/scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    which now runs and passes. It still needs parameterizing with tables.
    
    Added:
      features/trytond/account/scenario_account_reconciliation.feature
    which now runs and passes. It still needs parameterizing with tables.
    
    Added:
      features/trytond/product_cost_fifo/scenario_product_cost_fifo_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    which FAILS as it should for now because it is a copy of
      features/trytond/account_stock_anglo_saxon/scenario_account_stock_anglo_saxon.feature
    changed to use FIFO, but the accounting results have not yet been updated.
    
    Added:
       rst_to_feature.el
    I'll deny all knowledge of it :-)

    Added features/trytond/account/2013-10-scenario_account_reconciliation.feature
    and fixed the creation of the Minimal A chart of accounts to be idempotent.
