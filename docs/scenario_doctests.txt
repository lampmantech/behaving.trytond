   This is a straight cut-and-paste from
   trytond_*-2.8.*/tests/scenario_*.rst
   to refactor the doctests to eliminate duplication.
   All the steps in this file are used by all of
   the feature files that impelment the doctest scenari.
   The aim is to make each step idempotent, so that if
   you run a step again from another feature file,
   the work is not repeated, and will not error.
   That's easy in the early steps, but harder farther on,
   so some feature files will need to be run on their own.
   Most steps are commented as either idempotent or FixMe.
   It should be improved to be more like a Behave BDD.
