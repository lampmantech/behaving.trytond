   Invoice Supplier Scenario
   =========================
   This is a straight cut-and-paste from
   trytond_account_invoice-3.0.0/tests/scenario_invoice_supplier.rst
   It should be improved to be more like a Behave BDD.

   Create an invoice with description "{uDescription}" to supplier
   "{uSupplier}" with following |description|quantity|unit_price|account| fields
   Note that this uses the heading description rather than name
   | description       | quantity   | unit_price | account      | currency |
   | Services Bought   | 5	   | 		|              |          |
