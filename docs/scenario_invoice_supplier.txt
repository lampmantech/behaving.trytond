   =========================
   Invoice Supplier Scenario
   =========================
   This is a straight cut-and-paste from
   trytond_account_invoice-3.0.0/tests/scenario_invoice_supplier.rst
   It should be improved to be more like a Behave BDD.

**TS/AIS Create a ProductTemplate named "{uTemplateName}" with supplier_tax named "{uTaxName}" with fields**

**TS/AIS Create a product with description "{uDescription}" from template "{uTemplateName}"**
   Create a product with description "{uDescription}" from template "{uTemplateName}"
   Idempotent.

**TS/AIS Create an invoice with description "{uDescription}" to supplier "{uSupplier}" with fields**
   Create an invoice with description "{uDescription}" to supplier
   "{uSupplier}" with fields | description | quantity | unit_price |
   # Note that this uses the heading description rather than name
   | description       | quantity   | unit_price |
   | Services Bought   | 5	   | 		|
   | Test     	      | 1	   | 10.00	|

**TS/AIS Post the invoice with description "{uDescription}" and assert the taxes named "{uTaxName}" are right**

**TS/AIS Create a credit note for the invoice with description "{uDescription}" and assert the amounts**
   Create a credit note for the invoice with description "{uDescription}"
   and assert the amounts for the credit note equal the invoice amounts.
