   WIP - unfinished
   This would be a straight cut-and-paste from
   trytond_bank-3.2.0/tests/
   but trytond_bank doesn't have any meaningful tests.
   trytond_bank also doesn't have any documentation, meaningful or not.
   Which makes it pretty hard to figure out, especially as its classes
   have self-referential fields. Grr.

**Create a bank associated to a party "{uParty}" with optional BIC "{uBic}"**
   Create a named bank associated to a party, with optional BIC.
   Create the party first, with things like addresses, and
   then use this to create the bank.
   The uBic field can be empty; if not it has 11 characters.

**Create a bank account with IBAN "{uIban}" at a bank associated to a party "{uParty}", with following optional number, owner or currency**
   Create a bank account at a bank "{uBank}" with optional currency "{uCur},
   with a following table of | name | value |.
   Each name is one of number or owner.
   At least one number is required; if you want to add more,
   just run this scenario again with the new number.
