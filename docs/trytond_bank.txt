   WIP - unfinished
   This would be a straight cut-and-paste from
   trytond_bank-3.2.0/tests/
   but trytond_bank doesn't have any meaningful tests.
   trytond_bank also doesn't have any documentation, meaningful or not.
   Which makes it pretty hard to figure out, especially as its classes
   have self-referential fields. Grr.

**Create a bank associated to a party "{uParty}" with optional BIC "{uBic}"**
   Create a named bank associated to a party, with optional BIC.
   Create the party first, with things like addresses, and
   then use this to create the bank.
   The uBic field can be empty; if not it has 11 characters.

**Create a bank account with IBAN "{uIban}" at a bank associated to a party "{uParty}", with following optional number, owner or currency**
   Create a bank account with IBAN "{uBank}" associated with a party "{uParty}
   with a following table of | name | value |.
   Each name is one of: iban number owner or currency.
   Owner is a party name, and currency is a currency code.

**Create a sequence on account.journal named "{uBankSequenceName}"**
   Create a non-strict sequence on account.journal named "{uBankSequenceName}"
   Idempotent.

**Create a Bank Statement Journal named "{uName}" from the account.journal named "{uStatementAJName}" with currency "{uCur}"**
   Create an account.bank.statement.journal named "{uName}"
   from the account.journal named "{uStatementAJName}"
   with currency "{uCur}"
   Idempotent.

**Create a cash account.journal named "{uName}" from the sequence named "{uBankSequenceName}" with following |name|value| credit_account, debit_account fields**
   Create a cash account.journal named "{uName}"
   with the sequence named "{uBankSequenceName}"
   with a following |name|value| table
   with credit_account, debit_account fields, e.g.
   | name 	     	  | value	  |
   | credit_account  | Main Cash	  |
   | debit_account   | Main Cash	  |
   Idempotent.
