From: ../features/steps/trytond_constants.py


   These are the constants that are embedded in the Tryton
   code for their 'Minimal A' chart of accounts, and many
   of the tests. If the Tryton code changes, these will
   need updating, so its a little brittle, but they rarely do.
   As of trytond-2.8.2.
