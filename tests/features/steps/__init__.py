"""
The steps {{{features/steps/}}} module is where you import the steps code from
from the steps module of the behaving.trytond package: 
{{{
    from behaving.trytond.steps import *
}}}

You can also import steps from other behaving namespace packages. For example, 
to use {{{behaving.web}}}  in your steps, you would add another line like:
{{{
    from behaving.web.steps import *
}}}
