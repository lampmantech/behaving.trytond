Installation
------------

Once you have behave and proteus installed, there is no
installation required for trytond_scenari: simply change
to this directory and run behave. So far, it has only
been tested on postgres backends using proteus. The
most trivial test, which does not even use trytond is:
{{{
  behave --stop features/behave_test.feature
}}}
