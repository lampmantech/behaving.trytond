   This is the elementary behave test from its tutorial;
   see http://pythonhosted.org/behave/ or the docs/
   directory in the behave source distribion.
   If this test fails, behave is not properly installed.

**we have behave installed**
   If behave is not installed we couldnt get here!

**we implement a test**
   A trivial assertion.

**behave will test it for us!**
   The trivial assertion did not fail.
