=== Testing ===


As a rule, all tests within a directory should not interfere with each
other, it is expected that there is interference between directories.
So you cannot call behave from the root of the distribution.
You can call behave with {{{behave/*.feature}}} or
{{{behave/subdir/*.feature}}} for each subdirectory.

==== Tags ====

The current release should work with Tryton 3.6 with a couple of tagged
failures:look at each feature for the tags
{{{works32}}} {{{works34}}} {{{works36}}}, and {{{broken36}}}.
The latter means it was working, but has now broken in Tryton 3.6.
Usually these are minor problems, but we just haven't had the time to fix it.
To run only the features that are working in 3.6, use the
{{{
--tags="@works36"
}}}
argument to behave.

Finally the {{{@wip}}} tag means a Work in Progress, which may or may not
be working, or may not even be finished. To run only these features, use the
{{{
--wip
}}}
argument to behave. For details on behave's command line arguments,
see the [[Features-behave_test]] page in the wiki, or
the {{{behave_test.feature}}} file in {{{features/}}}.

The feature files, and the summaries of the available steps, are in the Wiki;
see the [[TitleIndex]] for the pages that start with Feature or Steps.
